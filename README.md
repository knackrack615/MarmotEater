# MarmotEater
MarmotEater is a useless program that adds 'Give it to the marmots' option on the right-click context menu

When you select a file and you select ‘Give it to the marmots’ it shows a window with a marmot eating the file

Also the file gets deleted

 

Its basically a better recycle bin (without the recycle part so be carefull not to feed the marmot accidentally)

 

Installation instructions can be found in ‘Instructions.txt’ inside the archive

 

By the way you can customize the marmot images under the folder “program/images/” :)
